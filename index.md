I am a fourth year graduate student in the [Psychology Department](https://psychology.illinois.edu/) at the Uiniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am a member of [Learning & Language Lab](http://learninglanguagelab.org/), advised by Dr. Jon Willits.

My research interests include semantic memory, representation of languge meaning (for both words and complex structures like phrases and sentences), and I study the topics with theoretical and computational modeling. In particular, I have been working on developing a semantic memory model which encodes raw distributional linguistic data in structured graphical forms, e.g. constituent trees, with the goal to represent the meaning of phrases and sentences generated from the productive natural language.
